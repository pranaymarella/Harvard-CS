1.  <stdint.h> is a header file that defines new integer types.
    The default integer types may vary becaue they are based on how the system was designed/implemented.
    Stdint is a header file that contains new integer types that can act as a standard across any kind of system.

2.  uint8_t, uint16_t, unit32_t are unsigned, so only positive values, and can only be 8, 16, or 32 (respectively) bits long.
    int32_t is signed, so it may contain negative and positive values, and it is of size 32 bits.

3.  A BYTE is a 1 byte (8 bits) unsigned value.
    A DWORD is a 4 byte (32-bits) unsinged integer.
    A LONG is a 4 byte (32-bits) signed integer.
    A WORD is a 2 byte (16-bit) unsigned integer.

4.  424d in hexadecimal must be the first two bytes of any BMP file.

5.  bfSize is the size, in bytes, of the bitmap file.
    biSize is specifying how many bytes are required for the structure BITMAPINFOHEADER

6.  biHeight is negative when it is indicating a top-down Device Independent Bitmap (DIB). These cannot be compressed.

7.  biBitCount is responsible for specifying the BMP's color depth.

8.  fopen might return NULL in lines 24 and 32 of copy.c if the user does not provide an input file AND an output file.
    Both are needed for copy.c to work.

9.  The thrid argument of fread is always 1 in our code because 1 is the number of elements we are reading at a time.

10. Padding is 3 when bi.biWidth is 3.

11. fseek changes the position of where the pointer is pointing so that we can skip over the padding, if there is any padding.

12. SEEK_CUR tells fseek that the offset is in the current position of the indicator.
